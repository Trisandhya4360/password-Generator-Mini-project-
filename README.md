PASSWORD-GENERATOR(MINI PROJECT)

*Purpose: The script generates a random password based on user input.
*User Input: Asks the user for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in the password.
*Random Selection: Uses random.choice() to pick characters from predefined lists (letters, symbols, and numbers).
*Password Creation: Adds the selected characters to a list (password_list).
*Shuffling: Randomizes the order of characters in the list using random.shuffle().
*Final Password: Converts the shuffled list into a string to display the final password.
*Output: The generated password is printed to the user
